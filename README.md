# COVID-19-study-by-SQL-and-visualization-by-Tableau
## Introduction
Since the pandemic of COVID-19 in early 2019, people's lives were dramatically changed. The aim of this study is to figure out the most recent situations of death rate, infected rate and vaccination rate of all the countries in the world by SQL and to create easy to read visualizations on that by Tableau. 

## Data Resource
The raw data was downloaded from [Our World in Data-Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), "Our World in Data" is a very useful data resource that provides updated and accurate data about all kinds of issues in the world. The raw data are saved by the file [CovidDeaths.csv](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/COVID-19-study-by-SQL-and-visualization-by-Tableau/blob/ab0e82682d23cec60bc29c4735ea2f482867a265/CovidDeaths.csv) and [CovidVaccine.csv](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/COVID-19-study-by-SQL-and-visualization-by-Tableau/blob/ab0e82682d23cec60bc29c4735ea2f482867a265/CovidVaccine.csv).

## SQL queries
The analysis was been implemented by postgreSQL database, the SQL codes are shown by the file[Covid_death_vaccine_study.sql](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/COVID-19-study-by-SQL-and-visualization-by-Tableau/blob/ab0e82682d23cec60bc29c4735ea2f482867a265/Covid_death_vaccine_study.sql). And the tables for data visualization were also created by postgreSQL, the codes are recorded by the file [COVID data SQL queries for Tableau.sql](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/COVID-19-study-by-SQL-and-visualization-by-Tableau/blob/ab0e82682d23cec60bc29c4735ea2f482867a265/COVID%20data%20SQL%20queries%20for%20Tableau.sql)
